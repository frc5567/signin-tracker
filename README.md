# signin_tracker_5567

An app to track sign in and out for Robotics practices

To use, input your name in the "input name" field and tap "sign in"
To sign out, select your name form the dropdown and tap sign out

Data formatting:
The data is outputted as a csv to the External Storage (android/data/com.frc5567.signin_tracker_5567/files).
The first column is the username, the second is sign in time, and the third is sign out. There will be a
row labelled None with a sign in time, that was when the app was launched.
